## Objectives

* To understand how to use directions to communicate instructions
* To learn how to interact in a small group(take turns, share)

## Description

In this activity, students are introduced to the directions associated with each command block and how they are used to program Cubetto.

## Steps 

* Introduce: Review the features of Cubetto: face, tail, wheels, etc. 

  > Today we are going to learn about the directions we use to program Cubetto. Cubetto always needs to see where it is going. When we look where we are going, our body faces that direction. Your feet are like Cubetto’s wheels.
* Anchor: Show a video of GPS or a map application, such as google map.

  > What words did the GPS use to give directions?
* As students name the directions from the video, show the corresponding vocabulary card (turn left, turn right)

  > Notice each direction is a different color. Turn left is yellow and turn right is red.
* Model: Show the vocabulary card go forward.

  > Show the vocabulary card go forward. Notice that go forward is green.
  >
  > There are 2 other directions that we will need to know. When we want to change direction, we will need to turn leftor turn right. **IMPORTANT: We turn in place—we do notturn andgo forward**
* Model: Show the vocabulary cards turn left and turn right.

  > Notice that turn left is yellow and turn right is red.







## Curriculum Connections

* Social Studies – People and Environments (mapping skills)
* Math – Geometry and Spatial Sense (directions, coordinates, grids), Number Sense (counting)

## Accessibility Considerations

## Skill Development

* The importance of clear communication
* Interpreting a simple map
* The use of basic directionality in daily activities
* Working together in a small group setting: sharing materials, turn-taking, and listening
